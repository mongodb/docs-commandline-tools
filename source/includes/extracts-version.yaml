  Starting with MongoDB 4.4, the {+dbtools+} are now released separately
  from the MongoDB Server and use their own versioning, with an initial
  version of ``100.0.0``. Previously, these tools were released
  alongside the MongoDB Server and used matching versioning.

  For documentation on the MongoDB 4.2 or earlier versions of these
  tools, reference the :manual:`MongoDB Server Documentation
  </reference/program>` for that version of the tool:
