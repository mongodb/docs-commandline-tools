      MongoDB 4.4 deprecates the use of the :update:`$currentDate`
      operator. For MongoDB 4.2 and later, you can use the aggregation
      variables :variable:`NOW` and :variable:`CLUSTER_TIME` as an
      alternative.

  .. versionchanged:: 4.4

    :binary:`~bin.mongod` / :binary:`~bin.mongos` logs a warning on
    connection if the presented x.509 certificate expires within ``30``
    days of the ``mongod/mongos`` host system time. See
    :ref:`4.4-rel-notes-certificate-expiration-warning` for more
    information.

ref: 4.4-validate-options
content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, you can run the :dbcommand:`validate`
   command in the background or in the foreground. In earlier versions,
   you can only run :dbcommand:`validate` in the foreground:

   - When run in |background| (available MongoDB 4.4+), the operation
     takes an intent shared lock on the collection and does not block
     reads and writes on the collection; however, the operation does
     not update collection count and size metrics.
 
   - When run in |foreground|, the operation takes an exclusive lock on
     the collection and blocks all reads and writes on the collection
     until the operation finishes. When run on a secondary, the
     operation can block all other operations on that secondary until
     it finishes.
