You can restore the BSON files generated from ``mongodump`` into MongoDB
deployments running the same or newer version as the source deployment.
However, restoring files into a newer version deployment is not the
recommended way to upgrade your deployment. To learn how to upgrade your
deployment, see the :manual:`upgrade documentation
</release-notes/{+server-version+}-upgrade>`.
